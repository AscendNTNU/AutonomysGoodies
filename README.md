A git repo filled with usefull functions for the autonomy group. The library is maintained by the current autonomy group. And maintains all usefull general purpose classes and functions developed throughout the years. To accomodate ROS2 and make the library more modular, the library is split into multiple packages. Each package is added here as a submodule. Use the packages you need and add them as a submodule to your project.
